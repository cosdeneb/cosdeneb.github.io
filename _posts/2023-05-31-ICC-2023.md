The [IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2023](https://icc2023.ieee-icc.org/) is the flagship event organized by the <font color='d2691e'>IEEE Communications Society</font>, renowned as one of the most prestigious international conferences in the field. The 2023 edition of the conference was held in <font color='#d2691e'>Rome</font>, <font color='#d2691e'>Italy</font>, from May 28 to June 1.

On the day of acceptance announcements for this conference, I am thrilled to announce that my paper, titled "[Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Passenger Delivery in Urban Air Mobility](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10279436)", was accepted for presentation at IEEE ICC 2023. It was a great honor to present my research at such a distinguished event ü•≥.

This paper proposes optimizing the efficiency of passenger delivery services in autonomous Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems ‚úàÔ∏è through a cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm using a Communication Network (CommNet). The approach involves centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE). I had the opportunity to present these findings in the <font color='#d2691e'>Aerial Communications</font> session under the <font color='#d2691e'>Selected Areas in Communications</font> track.

In addition to presenting my own work, I fully participated in the conference, engaging in academic exchanges across a wide range of fields including Big Data, Cloud Computing, Smart Grid, and Autonomous Systems. The diverse array of paper presentations provided valuable insights and fostered enriching scholarly interactions.

Building on the insights gained from the conference, I conducted realistic experiments using the vertiport map considered by Uber in the U.S. and actual UAM model specifications utilizing Joby Aviation's S4 model. By increasing the scalability of agents and incorporating more comparative groups and numerical experiments for performance evaluation, I further developed my research. This extended work was published under the title "[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Air Transportation Services in City-Wide Autonomous Urban Air Mobility](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10144378)" in the [IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7274857) <font color='#dc143c'>(IF:8.2)</font> in August 2023.
