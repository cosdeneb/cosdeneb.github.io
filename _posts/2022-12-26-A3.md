The <font color='#d2691e'>A3 Foresight Program</font> is a collaborative initiative jointly organized by three Asian countries: Korea (NRF) 🇰🇷, China (NSFC) 🇨🇳, and Japan (JSPS) 🇯🇵. The program aims to foster international cooperation by forming joint research teams across various fields of study. It facilitates researcher exchanges, joint seminars, and collaborative research projects, promoting academic and scientific advancements through shared expertise and resources.

The first joint seminar hosted by the A3 Foresight Program took place on December 26, 2022, in <font color='#d2691e'>Tokyo</font>, <font color='#d2691e'>Japan</font>. Various researchers from leading universities across the three Asian countries participated, presenting their papers and engaging in academic exchanges. I also presented my paper titled "[Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Reliable and Energy-Efficient Mobile Access via Multi-UAV Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00945)" which proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to optimize UAV 🚁 positioning as mobile base stations, enhancing energy efficiency and reliability in mobile access networks.

After the joint seminar, a banquet was held in the evening where several researchers were selected for the Best Presentation Award among many presenters. Here, I was honored to be one of the recipients and received the award from [Prof. Nei Kato](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfLfZXEAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao) of <font color='#d2691e'>Tohoku University</font>. Additionally, this international seminar of the A3 Foresight Program provided me with a valuable opportunity to engage in academic exchange and further develop my paper with [Dr. Tiago Koketsu Rodrigues](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=vwYVE_wAAAAJ) of <font color='#d2691e'>Tohoku University</font>.

Two months later, the A3 Foresight Program held its 2nd international joint seminar on February 21, 2023, in <font color='#d2691e'>Gangnam</font>, <font color='#d2691e'>Seoul</font>. I attended this seminar as well and presented the paper I had been working on with [Dr. Tiago Koketsu Rodrigues](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=vwYVE_wAAAAJ), titled "[Quantum Multiagent Actor–Critic Networks for Cooperative Mobile Access in Multi-UAV Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10143981)" which we had initiated during the 1st joint seminar.

I was fortunate to receive the Best Presentation Award at this seminar from [Prof. Saewoong Bahk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfLfZXEAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao) of <font color='#d2691e'>Seoul University</font> as well, becoming the first person to win awards at both events. Additionally, leveraging the valuable insights gained from this seminar, I further developed the paper I presented, which was subsequently accepted for publication in the [IEEE Internet of Things Journal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7274857) <font color='#dc143c'>(IF:10.6)</font> in November 2023.
