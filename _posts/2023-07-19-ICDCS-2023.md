One of the premier conferences in the field of computer systems, the [IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS) 2023](https://icdcs2023.icdcs.org/), was held from July 18 to July 21, 2023, in <font color='#d2691e'>Hong Kong</font>, <font color='#d2691e'>China</font>, hosted by the <font color='#d2691e'>IEEE Computer Society</font>. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to participate in this prestigious conference. A <font color='#d2691e'>demo short paper</font> that I co-authored was accepted, and I was also honored to have a <font color='#d2691e'>poster</font> that I authored as the first author accepted. This recognition at such a significant event in the field of distributed computing systems was incredibly rewarding ðŸ˜¼.

The left figure is my poster titled "[Coordinated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms in Autonomous Mobile Access Applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10272444)". Next, the right one is the poster for the demo short paper I co-authored, titled "[EQuaTE: Efficient Quantum Train Engine Design and Demonstration for Dynamic Software Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10272530)". For the demo short paper, we also prepared a demonstration [[video](https://youtu.be/PXHLxrdaCKs?si=AYv2qGSsme85ONET)] to showcase our work. Especially, by discussing the papers with many renowned scholars from abroad, I was able to identify areas for improvement and gain insights into future research trends and directions.
